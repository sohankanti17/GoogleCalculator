I am new to GitHub.

In this project I have tried to make an improved version of the google calculator in an android phone.

I have made all the buttons includind the side panel (all the functions need to be made).

I want you all to help me to complete this project.

Please help me coding the functions to make it work like the goolge calculator.
It is not responsive so will work on pc only.


Thank You.
